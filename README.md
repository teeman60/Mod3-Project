Mod 3 Project by Freddy Flores & Taiye Salami
# ABOUT
This is a simple gaming application using Ruby on Rails as the backend and vanilla JS on the frontend. In here is a collection of 3 different popular games (flappy bird, tetris and breakout) and the goal is to have a way for users to navigate between the different games and beat the best scores in each category. 

The most part of the frontend were written separately by Code Explained, a YouTube channel and we just consolidated them into one single application, wrote the code for  while providing some styling to our taste. We made a backend as a server to handle user account creation for the scores for each of the users.
